  "body": "# ElegyOfLife\r\n\r\n## Premise (high concept)\r\nSet in a kingdom where the lives of the inhabitants depend on a song, Elegy of Life is an action adventure game based on exploring and clearing dungeons in hopes of saving your home land. Played from a third person perspective in 3D, the player takes on the role of a young amnesiac character, wielding simply a rapier that they must use to ward off enemies. The player's objective is to make their way through dungeons to acquire the pieces they need to complete a weapon that will prove essential to defeat the villain: the composer who set a curse on this kingdom. The curse made it so that the people could only stay alive if they heard a song - a song dubbed, fittingly, the Elegy of Life. If they did not listen to it for too long, they would slowly grow weaker, and eventually die. But even the people don't know this - for them, it's just a song that is stuck in their head.\r\nThe player will also feel its effects, and will have to make use of an instrument to keep themselves alive. Their life power (their Health Points) will slowly drain away otherwise. The main character has a part of the song, and can acquire more by talking to certain people, or other means we have yet to determine.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Player motivation\r\nThe player is driven by the desire to explore and to save its kingdom. By offering a variety of dungeons and obstacles, as well as new abilities to acquire, the player should feel motivated to traverse the dungeons and defeat the bosses.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Unique selling Proposition (USP)\r\nThe game offers a unique mechanic (the song and its effects) that is paired up with puzzles that the player must attempt to solve while keeping tabs on their life points.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Target market\r\nThe game-playing audience targeted with this game are the casual gamers in a young age.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Genre\r\nAction-adventure game\r\n\r\n\r\n## Target platform and HW requirements\r\nMinimum requirements: PC with Windows 7 64-bit, 8 GB RAM and a quad-core Intel or AMD processor, and a DX11 compatible video card.\r\n\r\n## Goals\r\nFor this game, our expectations are that the player embraces the musical theme and understands the huge part it takes on the process of surviving and clearing the game. Also, given the genre of the game, we want the player to get excited as his adventure progresses and, while managing his resources, enjoy the ambient created specially for a great gaming experience.\r\nTo do this, we include a new weapon the player can acquire, a multitude of locations, and game mechanics that incite the player to explore and as mentioned before, the musical themed aspects of the game allow us to create a good experience for the player and only by using their songs will the player be able to succeed and achieve victory. With the firm collaboration between the two different areas of expertise that are Engineering and Arts we expect to create a product that is rich on a mechanical level and in terms of visuals, thus joining the best of both worlds.\r\n",
